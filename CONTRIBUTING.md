# Contributing

The strength of Babylon.js is the incredible community it has built up. All
contributions are welcome. If you have something you would like to see added,
feel free to open a pull request.

The easiest way to get started is to navigate to a file on GitHub, click the
edit icon, make your changes, and follow the instructions for submitting a pull
request.

Please keep these basic rules in mind:

1. **All links must have a purpose.** This isn't just a collection of every
    BabylonJS resource on the internet. It's a directory to the most practical
    uses of Babylon for game development.
2. **Open Source.** Babylon already has a list of great games on their community
    page. Most of those games are closed-source. Awesome Babylonjs should be
    helpful for game developers, so open-source content is strongly preferred
    (if not required).
3. **No self-promotion.** We all want recognition, but this isn't the place for
    you to show off. Please ask someone else to add your work for you.
4. **Follow the formatting rules.** Try to keep the layout consistent by using
    the same text format already in use.
    1. Demos/projects should use the following format: `[title](link) - description. (link to source code)`
    2. Playground examples should use the following format: `descriptive title - <link>`.
5. **Keep links in alphabetical order.** This greatly helps navigation.
6. **Only remove what isn't helpful.** It is okay to remove projects that are
    either broken or deprecated by another project or by its author. Whenever
    possible, favor replacing a broken link with a backup on
    [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/) over removing it.
7. End all descriptions with a period (unless the final word contains a period,
    like Babylon.js).
8. Check your spelling and grammar.
9. Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace and uses Unix line returns.
